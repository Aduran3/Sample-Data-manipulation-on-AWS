# Sample-Data-manipulation-on-AWS-database
Used AWS database services to manipulate and display sample data.

My AWS was unfortunatly closed, losing my source code.
Thankfully, I saved screenshots of the code and results.

Uploaded sample data from a previously created tables. The data is then manipulated 
and displayed in various ways for the user.

The two SQL files are the sample data that is manipulated
